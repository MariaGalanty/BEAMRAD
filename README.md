# BEAMRAD
BEAMRAD is a dynamic tool designed to create and assess medical dataset documentation. It was introduced in the publication "Assessing the documentation of publicly available medical image and signal datasets and their impact on bias using the BEAMRAD tool" by Galanty M, Luitse D, Noteboom SH, Croon P, Vlaar AP, Poell T, Sanchez CI, Blanke T, and Išgum I. This repository provides two main versions of the tool:

- For data creators: A guided process to help build comprehensive and bias-aware documentation for medical datasets.

- For data users: A version focused on evaluating and assessing the documentation quality of existing datasets.

We welcome all contributions to improve and expand the BEAMRAD tool. Feel free to open issues and  suggest enhancements!
