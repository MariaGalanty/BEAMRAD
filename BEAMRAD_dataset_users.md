    1. Open access – no requirements for access or only sign-in
    2. Open access with barriers – datasets fulfilling the theoretical criteria for open access, but are inaccessible because of unpredictable reasons (e.g., no response to requests or broken hyperlinks)

8. **Is there information about the origin of data** **(e.g., country and hospital)?**  

9. **Is it a single-center or multi-center study?  
    **
10. **Are the criteria for data inclusion described? (e.g., consecutive participants, inclusion and exclusion criteria)**.  

11. **Are there relevant characteristics (e.g., level of expertise) of the subjects (e.g., surgeon)/objects (e.g., robot) involved in the data acquisition process?**  

12. I**s there any information on the data anonymization protocol?**

**Metadata**

1. **Is there information about the participant (e.g., age, medical history)? If relevant, what are the features, variable types, and the number of categories provided for the variable?**  

2. **Is any information provided along with the data?** If yes, what kind of information?  

3. **Is there information about the hardware used for the data acquisition?** (i.e. the vendor and the specific model)  

4. **Is there general information about the data acquisition protocol, such as view or modality?** If so, what kind of information is provided?

**Sample size**

1. **What is the number of participants and the number of data samples?**  

2. **If there is more than one inclusion for a participant, what is the number of data samples per participant?**

**Missing data**

1. **Is the information about missing values provided?** What information are missing?

**Training and test set distribution**

1. **Is data divided into training/test sets?** If the dataset consists of training/test sets, how is the data distributed?  

2. **Are both the training and test datasets available?**
3. **Is there an explanation for the potential differences between distributions of the data subjects in the training and test sets and the real-world distribution?**

**Data Annotation**

1. **What types of annotations are included in this dataset?**  

2. **Are the data annotation methods explained?**

8. **If there are multiple annotations, is the approach to reaching a consensus on the final labels described by the dataset’s creators?**

**Data preprocessing**

1. **Is the data preprocessed? If yes, how was the data preprocessed?** What were the methods (e.g., cropping, resampling, and contrast enhancement).

**Sources of errors**

1. **Are the most relevant possible sources of error (e.g., error through annotation variability) described in the documentation of the dataset?**
2. **Are the most relevant error sources quantified?** (For instance, by giving specific information for training, validation and test cases?). If so, please provide a list of the quatifications.
